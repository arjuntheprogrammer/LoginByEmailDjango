Here is an example of an admin-compliant custom user app. 
This user model uses an email address as the username, and has a required date of birth; 
it provides no permission checking, beyond a simple admin flag on the user account. 
This model would be compatible with all the built-in auth forms and views, except for the user creation forms. 
This example illustrates how most of the components work together, 
but is not intended to be copied directly into projects for production use.
